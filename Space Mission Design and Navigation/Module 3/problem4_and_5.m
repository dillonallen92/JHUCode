%% Problem 4
% Calculate the amount of time that starman spends its orbit under 1 AU.
% Note that you must make sure that the second mean anomaly is greater than
% the first by adding 2*pi




%% Problem 5
% Independently calculate the amount of time that starman spends above 1
% AU and verify that this and the value obtained in 4 add up to the orbital
% period.
