% Assume that Earth and Saturn are on circular orbits. Neglecting their gravity, calculate
% the Hohmann transfer to go from Earth to Saturn

%% Part A
% Calculate the time of flight, dv1 and dv2

%% Part B
% A launch from Earth can be estimated assuming v_inf = dv1. What is the C3 and how does
% this value ompare to the C3 of the truncated trajectory from the previous problem?

%% Part C
% What would be our new estimate for a dv required to capture into a 200 day orbit about 
% Saturn if we make the approximation that v_inf = dv2 for Saturn?

%% Part D
% Given the tof what is the relative angular position between Earth and Saturn at launch?
