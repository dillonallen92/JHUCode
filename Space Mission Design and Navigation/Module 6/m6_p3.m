% If instead of a Hohmann transfer we decide to put the sc on a transfer orbit with
% radius of periapsis equal to the radius of Venus' orbit and radius of apoapsis equal
% to 10 times the radius of Saturns orbit:

%% Part A
% Calculate the tof, dv1, dv2

%% Part B
% What is the estimate for launch C3?

%% Part C
% What is the new estimate for a dv required to capture into a 200 day orbit about Saturn?
