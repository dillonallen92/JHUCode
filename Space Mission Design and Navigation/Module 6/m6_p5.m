% A sc is maneuvering from a circular LEO of 200 km to a circular orbit of a much greater
% altitude of 92294 km

%% Part A
% Calculate the tof, dv1, dv2 for the Hohmann Transfer

%% Part B
% Calculate dv1, dv2, dv3 and the tof for a bi-elliptic transfer for ri = 2r2.

%% Part C
% As discussed in the textbook the total dv for the bi-elliptic transfer should be less than
% the Hohmann option. What are some of the limiting factors that could forbid Earth orbiting 
% sc from executing a bi-elliptic transfer for even higher altitudes
